# Project Description

The project is based on the statistics of epidemiology related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We specifically focus on the effects of socioeconomic factors and vaccination rates on the number of COVID-19 cases in Maryland at the county level. To analyze the COVID-19 case numbers, we implement two main models: ordinary least squares and weighted least squares models. Based on those models, we aim to provide some interpretations about the effects of such independent variables on the dependent variable: the number of cases. 

The code that we have implemented to perform the analyses are available at the following link:
